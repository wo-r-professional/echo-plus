* if `base.json` exists, but localstorage item `config` does not, then create it using the base.json configuration. **(probably should just use a const variable called base_temp to do this on)**
* add all the features in base.json for the functionality of script.js
* do stylesheet (keep all images except for the sidemenu and avatars)
