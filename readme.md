# Proview for Echo
An extension for Echo that offers a range of fixes, features, and redesigns, all focused on significantly enhancing the user experience. This tool is especially valuable for improving the interface of what is often seen as a poorly designed website. The site's limitations were my main motivation for developing this extension.

# Using/Installing the Extension
If you have experience with manually installing extensions, you'll find the process straightforward. However, for first-time users, it might seem a bit challenging. To assist, I've created a comprehensive wiki section with all the necessary information.

# Hope You Enjoy
I spent a very, very long time over several repositories and integrations to the extensions, the styling, and everything. Me being a relatively new coder found it hard, but I think this will be the last one I do. Thanks for using it.
